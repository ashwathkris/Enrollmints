## Project Summary

**EnrollMints** seeks to revolutionize the course registration experience offered by the Illinois Self-Service portal by addressing key deficiencies we observed in the current system. By creating a new course registration site, our goal is to enhance the academic experience by providing a comprehensive solution that not only streamlines the registration process but also offers advanced features such as a dashboard for tracking degree progress, detailed course and professor information, course reviews, and tailored course suggestions based on interests and requirements. This holistic approach ensures students are well-informed and in compliance with university policies, thereby simplifying the complexities associated with managing degree requirements and course enrollments.


The usefulness of our application is rooted in its ability to consolidate critical information and functionalities into a single, user-friendly platform, significantly improving upon the fragmented and cumbersome process currently in place. Unlike the existing self-service portal, which requires users to navigate through multiple pages to access course details, reviews, ratings, and enrollment options, our application offers a one-stop solution for all registration-related needs. By integrating a dashboard summary that provides real-time updates on degree completion progress and implementing an efficient waitlist management system with visibility into queue positions, our application not only addresses the existing system's shortcomings but also introduces innovative features that enhance the overall user experience. The introduction of such a system is a step towards mitigating the administrative hurdles faced by students, thereby allowing them to focus more on their academic pursuits and less on navigating bureaucratic challenges.
